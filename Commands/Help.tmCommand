# Introduction

The Gnuplot bundle is a set of snippets and completion commands designed to help you use [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), an incredibly powerful plotting utility.

# Completion

This bundle attempts to adapt to the many different commands available on different gnuplot builds by using your system's gnuplot binary for completion where possible. 

This is expecially useful for the commands `set`, `set terminal` and `show`. If you can't remember whether your gnuplot binary supports 'pdf', just type:

&lt;pre&gt;terminal⇥&lt;/pre&gt;
then press `p`, and press escape to see the possible completion options.

In some cases, gnuplot doesn't print possible options, in which case, completions are either hard coded, or not present. To see where completions are available, see the bundle contents.


# Testing

To quickly test if the gnuplot is correctly installed, you can use the 'test' snippet. Just set the file type to `Gnuplot` and then type `test⇥`, to get some test code. Then run it with `⌘R`. 
You should be prompted for a filename.

# Notes

For best/any results, you'll need TextMate to be able to see a `gnuplot` binary. 

To find out if it can, type: `which gnuplot` into an empty file, and press ⌃R. You should see something like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;which gnuplot
/usr/local/bin/gnuplot&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't, then make sure you have gnuplot installed. Typical instalation commands are:
 * brew install gnuplot --with-aquaterm --with-pdflib-lite (after manually installing AquaTerm)
 * fink install gnuplot-nox
 * port install gnuplot
 * installing the Octave Mac OS X build will give you a bundled version of Gnuplot.app. You can use the binary directly by looking in `Gnuplot.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnuplot`

For information on modifying Textmate's search path, see [this part of the manual](http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/shell_commands#search_path).
